    chmod +x /etc/init.d/bittorrent

* Add to chkconfig

    chkconfig --add bittorrent

* Set to start on system startup if desired

    chkconfig bittorrent on

* If you want non-root users to be able to control it, put this in your
  visudo, replace "username" with your non-priveledged username

    username localhost=NOPASSWD:/etc/init.d/bittorrent*

    alias bittorrent='/etc/init.d/bittorrent'
    alias bt='bittorrent'

## Requirements

* A non-priveledged user to run rtorrent, this can either be a new user
  just to run torrents, or an existing user

* Absolute session path in the .rtorrent.rc file

    session = ~/.session               ## this will break
    session = .session                 ## so will this

  Paths for other actions such as monitoring directories for .torrent files
  and auto-moving complete downloads don't have to be absolute.
